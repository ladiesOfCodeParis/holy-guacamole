# Ladies of Code Paris - Site 

Welcome to Ladies of Code Paris Website repository. 

The website is powered by Hugo (and the sweet [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) theme) and it is deployed on Netlify. 

## Checkout the project 
- [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). You need to use version 0.87.0: [this](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/switching-hugo-versions/38251/2) is the process on MacOS.
After installing the prerequisites, you need to go [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/08dc022766c7f8030d0cbc090849fd94ca70a885/Formula/hugo.rb),
click on "download raw file", save it as `hugo.rb`, then run:
```
brew install hugo.rb
```
- Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ladiesOfCodeParis/holy-guacamole.git
```
